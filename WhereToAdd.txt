When you want to add a new URI For example editParametersForFunction you must add a class to the IOTController Class, located in the iot.router package please follow the format in that class

When you want to make ar equest to this URI (lets say a PUT Request in ordeer to edit a parameter for a function) you must send an AJAX Request to the uri just created

this should be done in a javascript file using JQuery. JQuery is the only library that allows you to send an AJAX Request so this library is not replacable. Yo can create your
Javscript file in the static/js package.

When one would like to create an HTML file please look into the templates package.

All jars should be stored in the jars module.

Any exceptions should be stored in the exceptions package

When you would like to make a database query, please look into the Objects class located in the iot.database package. This package contains an abstract superclass known
as DatabaseTemplate, Objects is a subclass of this super class. In order to create a new class invoking database queries, please make sure this is a subclass of the
DatabaseTemplate class. The Objects class contains an enumeration with all the queries that are used in this application. If/when you would like to create your own class
to make requests to the database please ensure you have an enum containing all Database Queries
